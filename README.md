# gas-modeling
This project is designed to simulate turbulent gas flow around various obstacles using the Navier-Stokes equations. It includes both explicit and implicit numerical schemes for solving these equations and provides a graphical interface for setting simulation parameters and visualizing results in both 2D and 3D formats.
