# Turbulent Flow Simulation around Obstacles

This project is designed to simulate turbulent gas flow around various obstacles such as rectangles and circles using the Navier-Stokes equations. It includes both explicit and implicit numerical schemes for solving these equations. The project also features a graphical user interface (GUI) developed with PyQt, allowing users to set simulation parameters, visualize results, and analyze data in both 2D and 3D formats.

## Features

- Numerical solution of Navier-Stokes equations
- Explicit and implicit numerical schemes
- 2D and 3D visualization of simulation results
- User-friendly GUI for setting simulation parameters
- Adjustable mesh size and initial conditions
